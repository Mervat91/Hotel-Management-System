# Hotel-Management-System
This is a simple hotel management system using c++
First the user specifies whether he is a customer or a manager.
If the user is a customer,
the program asks him to log in first and register his own password.
After logging in,
a welcome message appears in the form of a notification.
After that, 
a list appears showing the available rooms and reservation rooms and
shows the rooms booked by the customer and
the menu and exits the program.
If the user is a hotel manager,
a welcome message appears in the form of a notification.
After that, a list of food inventory appears in case he wants to add or 
withdraw food from the inventory or
display the existing inventory after adding or
withdrawing from it.
